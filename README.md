# Chordline

**Chordline** is a modular narrative design and simulation framework, with support for branching storytelling, emotional modeling, and game system integration.
It is built as an open-source Godot plugin providing both toolkit and runtime library.

## Repository Structure

* `/ai-instructions/` - Instructions used to set up AIs to be more helpful
* `/bible/` - Project design bible and documentation
* `/core/` - Main Godot plugin source code
* `/examples/` - Sample games and demos
* `/tests/` - Automated test suites
* `/tools/` - CLI tools or support scripts

 **Note on Documentation**
 This repository can be used as a [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) vault compatible with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
 Obsidian is used for managing the design bible, internal documentation, and cross-linked development notes.
 You can browse the files directly, but using Obsidian enables rich linking, tag-based navigation, and embedded diagrams.

## Official Plugins

TBD
## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo or download and unpack a release.
2. (Recommended) Explore `/bible/` to understand the project philosophy and architecture.

## Use of AI

AI, specifically OpenAI's ChatGPT, has been used as a **collaborator and assistant** throughout the development of Chordline. Its role includes:

- **Design Collaboration**: Many of the early ideas around narrative systems, emotional modeling, and plugin architecture were developed through back-and-forth conversations with AI around the human author's vision and goals.
- **Documentation Support**: Much of the writing in this repository, including parts of the design bible and this README, has been drafted or revised with AI assistance to help clarify structure, language, and presentation.

At present, no source code has been generated by AI. Code may be co-developed or reviewed by AI in the future under the direction of the authors.

> This is **not** an AI-generated project. The human authors remain the final arbiters of all design and writing decisions. AI is used as a **thinking partner** â€” a collaborator that helps refine, challenge, and document ideas.
