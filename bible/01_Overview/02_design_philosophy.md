## One sentence
Chordline is built on the principle that emotionally expressive, narratively reactive systems should be author-driven, observable, modular, and capable of modeling human nuance—without requiring authors to manually orchestrate every emotional beat.
## More complete
Chordline’s design philosophy centers on empowering authors to create emotionally rich, character-driven stories through systems that model relationships, moods, appearances, and behaviors with psychological nuance and runtime dynamism.
Emotional states are structured around concepts like Plutchik’s Wheel, with clear separation between baseline dispositions and transient moods—both of which evolve over time and in response to off-screen or on-screen events.

The system is built for **observability** and **authorship-first tooling**, ensuring that emotional states, decay mechanics, and relationship changes are not opaque simulations but transparent and inspectable narrative levers.
Modularity is prioritized: optional features (e.g., cultural norms, curses, emotional coupling) can be toggled or provided as mods, and the system is engine-agnostic in structure, but designed for tight integration with expressive engines like Godot when 3D performance is involved.

Player-facing and author-facing systems share a unified emotional model, supporting dynamic QA tools, localization-aware behavior, culturally mixed casts, and a commitment to clarity, narrative coherence, and emotional believability.
Chordline treats emotion not as metadata, but as a first-class agent in how stories are told, evolve, and respond to the player's choices.
