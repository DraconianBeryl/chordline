# More complete

**Chordline** is a general-purpose emotional state and relationship modeling system designed to support complex, character-driven storytelling in interactive media—particularly **visual novels** and similar narrative engines.
Drawing from psychological frameworks like **Plutchik’s Wheel of Emotions**, the system enables both **short-term mood dynamics** and **long-term relational baselines**, facilitating nuanced emotional arcs and dynamic character interactions.

The system provides a modular and extensible foundation that includes:

- A **layered emotional model** (mood overlays vs. baseline emotions)

- Per-character **emotional decay rates**, **relationship descriptors**, and **expression guidance**

- A runtime engine supporting **event-driven emotional updates**, **mood decay mechanics**, and **baseline promotions**

- Integration affordances for **non-visible events**, **culturally-informed expression logic**, and **appearance-based selectors**

- Design-time features for **emotional simulation**, **timeline previewing**, and **emotionally-aware authoring tools**

- Tooling support for **testing**, **fuzzing**, **emotional state validation**, and **localization-aware debugging**

- A flexible, future-proof architecture planned as a **Godot-based plugin**, with provisions for **modding**, **appearance control**, and **cross-save persistence**


Chordline’s goal is to shift the burden of emotional bookkeeping from writers to a runtime system that ensures **authentic, emergent, and inspectable emotional continuity**—without sacrificing authorial intent or player clarity.

# Development Story

This project was designed by a human using an AI assistant.
Over the course of several conversations the human provided the main ideas and direction while the AI helped to fill in the gaps and act as a sounding board, elaborating on brief descriptions of additional features.
In some cases the human asked the AI for suggestions, evaluated the options presented, and then made the final decision.
